- planets and their number of moons (bar graph)
- planets, their masss, and their number of moons (scatter plot with color differentiation)
- planets and their mass (ranking, min/max chart visualizations)
- planets, their mass, and their diameter (scatter plot with size differentiation)
- planets, their volume, and their average temperature (chart visualization with coloring and scatter plot with color differentiation)
